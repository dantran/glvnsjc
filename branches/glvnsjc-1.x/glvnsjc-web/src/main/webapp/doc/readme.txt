Dear TC,

St Patrick PM has a student/teacher database system that we think it is 
SUPER useful for our GLVN at San Jose.

The purpose of this website is to automate all student tracking tasks that 
we have to do during the year.  So here is a list of most common 
scenarios and their solutions:


   1.  Frere sends out a preliminary list new school year students.
       
	Solution: Use import tool available in "admin" account to 
                  import Frere's spreadsheet to database.

   2.  School Principal assigns classes into subclasses
       (ie GL1A, GL1B, VN3A, VN3B, etc)

       Solution:  Frere creates "principal" account for each school
                  Each principal logins and assign classes. Note 
                  principal can only see student records of his/own school
                  

   3.  Teacher want to see her/her student records
       
       Solution: School principal creates "teacher" account for each
                 teacher/teacher aid who is RESPONSIBLE to update
                 student records.
                 
                 Teacher logins and search for student records of
                 any particular class using a generic search form.

                 Teacher can lookup student using wild card 
                 search on name, phone, date of birth, class name, etc

   4.  Frere sends a new update list of students

       Solution: Use the import tool again to import Frere's new spreadsheet to
                 database.  The import tool will make sure not to overwrite
                 previous changes made by principal/teacher

   5.  School begins and student class changes, like assigning new VN class to 
       a student based on his/her own level.

       Solution:  Teacher of both VN and GL classes make changes accordingly 
                  to the actual present student in their class. This task consists of:

                  - For all students NOT in the class roster, the teacher
                    will use the search engine to find the student based on name,
                    phone, or date of birth and move those those students to his/her
                    own class.

                  - For all students in the class roster but not present in the class, 
		    change the class assignment to none.

                  These tasks to be done in the 4th weeks of school year

   6.  Assign grade.

       Solution: Each VN/GL teacher fills the grade of all students using a single
                 form. The grade can be P(pass), F(fail), 1, 2, 3, 4.  

                 Principal can use grade info to printout award certificate 
                   (not more last minute hand written)

   7. Student application labels:

       Solution: Export student grade report to excel to be use as data source
                 for label printing (MS mail merge feature)
